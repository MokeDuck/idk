	<h2> Entry 2: The Orgins of the duckfather.</h2>


      <p class="lead"> The duckfather is a Legendary figure in the world of ducks. He is the one who started it all. He is the one who created the first quack and used it to create silly ducks from 
nothing. He is the one who keeps ducks a secret from the outside world. He is the one who fought against secret government agencies.<BR>
<BR>
No one knows where the duckfather came from. Some say he was born from a quack. Others say he was born from an egg. But no one really knows. <BR>
<BR>

It began long ago, in a time when ducks were just a myth. The duckfather was the first to quack and create silly ducks from nothing. He was the one who first fought against secret government agencies 
and kept ducks a secret from the outside world. He has fought the spies and won many times, but his greatest victory was when he finally revealed ducks to the world. When the duckfather first started his fight, 
there were no other ducks around. He used his quacks to create a gang of ducks, and together they fought against secret government agencies. The duckfather was the leader of the gang, and he led them to many
victories. The duckfather has always been a mystery, even to the other ducks. He never reveal his real name or where he came from. He is always shrouded in secrecy, but his quacks have always been loud and clear. 
The duckfather has fought against secret government agencies for many years, and he has never been defeated.<BR>
<BR>
It's a tough life being the duckfather. Leading a secret gang of ducks is no easy feat, especially when you're constantly being targeted by government agencies. But the duckfather has never backed 
down from a fight.<BR>
<BR>
The duckfather has fought hard against the spies who have tried to infiltrate his gang. He knows that if they were to discover the truth about the ducks, it would be disastrous. But he's not going 
to let them get their hands on his ducks, no matter what it takes. Long ago, when the Duckfather was still young, he swore to protect these creatures. And he's never going to break that promise. 
When the spies attacked the duckfather, a dramatic battle ensued. The duckfather was outnumbered and outgunned, but he didn't give up without a fight. He used every trick in the book to keep the 
spies at bay, and in the end, he emerged victorious. The duckfather knows that it's only a matter of time before the spies come back, but he's ready for them. He's not going to let them take his 
ducks away from him. The spies want to turn his ducks into commonplace woodland creatures. They often do, but that doesn't stop The Duckfather. One day, the duckfather will find a way to put an 
end to the spying once and for all. In the past, the spies have used quacks to create silly ducks from nothing. The duckfather has fought hard against the spies who have tried to infiltrate his 
gang. He knows that if they were to discover the truth about the ducks, it would be disastrous. But he's not going to let them get their hands on his ducks, no matter what it takes. Long ago, when 
the Duckfather was still young, he swore to protect these creatures. And he's never going to break that promise.<BR>
